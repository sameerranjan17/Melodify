🎵 Melodify
Melodify is a sleek, high-performance music streaming UI inspired by Spotify. This project was developed as a deep dive into Tailwind CSS, focusing on utility-first styling, complex layouts, and responsive design principles.
🚀 Overview
The goal of Melodify was to transition from traditional CSS to a modern, utility-first workflow. It replicates the sophisticated dark-themed interface of Spotify while maintaining a lightweight and performant codebase.
Key Features
💠Pixel-Perfect UI: Closely follows the Spotify design system (sidebar, player, and grid).
💠Fully Responsive: Seamlessly transitions from desktop to mobile using Tailwind's breakpoint system.
💠Custom Theming: Utilized tailwind.config.js to implement custom brand colors and spacing.
💠Interactive Elements: Leveraged group-hover and transitions for a premium "app-like" feel.🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first approach)
Icons: Lucide React / Heroicons
Deployment: [Vercel/Netlify link if applicable]
🧠 What I Learned (Tailwind Focus)
As a computer science student, I used this project to master specific CSS-in-JS concepts:
1. Grid & Flexbox Mastery: Built the 3-column layout (Sidebar, Main, Activity) using purely utility classes.
2. Arbitrary Values: Used h-[calc(100vh-80px)] to ensure the scrollable area perfectly fits the viewport minus the player height.
3. Optimization: Purged unused CSS to keep the production bundle extremely small.
4. Glassmorphism: Implemented backdrop-blur on the bottom music player for a modern aesthetic.
